Project scope: create a database for community healthcenters to add or update data about the population and the social determinants of health (SDOH) so organizations can make data-driven decisions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Database.py: This file handles database setup and connection logic. It uses SQLite to create a database that stores city-level demographic and SDOH data, ensuring the schema exists before the application runs.
2) Models.py: This file uses object-oriented programming to represent cities and manage how they are stored and retrieved from the SQLite database.
3) Main.py: It acts as the control center of the application, managing user interaction through a CLI, coordinating database operations through repositories, validating user input, and triggering data analysis, while keeping all logic modular and maintainable.
4) Analysis.py: It transforms raw city-level data stored in SQLite into meaningful demographic and social determinant insights using pandas, enabling comparison, ranking, and interpretation of disparities across cities.
